            The website is in a very blank state right now as I begin to design and develop it.
            I plan to add sample code, my software credentials, links to sites I find useful, and
            blog entries where I discuss my philosophies regarding software development and best
            practices.

        <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
            In the meantime, I have a skeleton structure designed which you may navigate and my resume which is current as of 9/24/2023.
            Welcome, and please continue to visit as I develop my portfolio!
